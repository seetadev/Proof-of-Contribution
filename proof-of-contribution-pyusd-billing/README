Paypal's PyUSD deployment + usage in Proof of Contribution 

We integrate PayPal’s KYC flow and PyUSD stablecoin payouts as a core part of the developer invoicing and billing toolkit, enabling compliant, instant global payments to verified contributors.

PayPal identity verification and PyUSD demonstrates how PayPal’s rails can power secure, regulated payouts to enable Web3 infrastructure projects to pay and incentivize contributors and scale contributions.
