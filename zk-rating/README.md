#### Ethereum Foundation's mopro and zkPDF usage in Proof of Contribution 

Our privacy-preserving attestations using zkPDF, on-chain proof verification, and reward token logic, accessibility of using invoice on mobile devices using mopro toolkit are all built on Ethereum-compatible chains using Solidity smart contracts and zk-proof tooling (Circom/Semaphore).
 By advancing reproducible, verifiable contributor proofs and zk-based privacy on Ethereum infrastructure, the project directly aligns with the Ethereum Foundationâ€™s mission to support decentralized, privacy-focused applications and next-generation zk technology.
